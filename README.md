# Welcome to Backpacker Budget
Backpacker Budget helps users to plan and execute long term trips by creating trip budgets with custom categories and 
target daily expenses. While on a trip, a custom dashboard allows the user to enter expenses and easily track their 
spending over time. It was developed using ASP.NET, Entity Framework and .NetCore MVC; with Razor pages along with jQuery 
and Materialize for client side UI.
